# This script deletes a single container together with its profile and all its
# volumes without deleting its workspace.
#
# Please note this script doesn't delete any images.
#
# WARNING: We've recently detected some information is being kept after just
# deleting a single container, so use the following script at your own risk.
# Until further notice, if you want to re-create your container without
# deleting your workspace, we recommend you to run
# `vagrant destroy && vagrant up` from your runway directory (outside your VM).
# It's slower, but we know no data will be kept other than the workspace.
